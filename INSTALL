This is the installation file for the NetStore package.

MANDATORY PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building NetStore:

LibCurl, v7.19.0 or later
A client-side URL transfer library. Included with most distros, or
available at: http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/.

OpenSSL, v1.0.2k or later
General purpose cryptography library. Available at https://www.openssl.org/.

Qt4 Toolkit, v4.6 or better
Most modern Linux distros include this. It can also be downloaded directly
at http://www.qt.io/.

Once the prerequisites are set up, installation is most often a matter of 
cd'ing to the top of the NetStore source tree and typing
'./configure', 'make', followed (as root) by 'make install'. Those
who obtained the source via Git will need to do './autogen.sh' first.
